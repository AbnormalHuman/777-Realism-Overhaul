# 777-Realism-Overhaul
<br>

**Description:** <br>
  777 Realism Overhaul is a plugin for GeoFs that revamps the 777-300ER with new fly-by-wire controls, envelope protection, new sounds, smooth gear tilt, and more minor changes to your flight experience. <br>
<br>

**Features:**<br>
Control Dampening; Now controls will feel heavier and less responsive. You can no longer immediately defelct the control surfaces based on yoke position. There is an actuation time.<br>
New Sounds; The generic LRX sounds are now replaced by high-quality recordings of the aircraft. <br>
Alarms; The aircraft now has realistic alarm feedback, including GPWS callouts.<br>
Smooth Gear Tilt; An experimental form of gear tilt has been implemented, it is rather buggy at the moment, but it gets the job done.<br>
Flight Envelope Protections; The new FBW system will keep you from exceeding the operational limits of the aircraft.<br>
Fly-By-Wire; The aircraft is now equipped with true-to-life FBW systems, based on simulations of the real thing. It includes a Yaw Damper, Climb holding, roll stabilization, and much more.
